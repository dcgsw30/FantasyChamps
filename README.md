# My Personal Project - FantasyChamps Forecast

In fantasy basketball, the most successful team is one that achieves the highest fantasy points per week. Generally, 
the fantasy points scoring system is based on several quantitative measures, such as goals made, field throws made, 
assists, and blocks. However, team performance per week fluctuates depending on game schedules,
player injuries, and roster changes. My application will enable the fantasy user to add basketball players on their 
fantasy team 
roster into the team list inside the application. With additional inputs, such as the players' statistics, health 
status, and the number of games scheduled that week, 
my application will calculate and forecast the amount of fantasy points that each player will get per week and the
cumulative number of points that the entire team will generate. 

This application will be used by **competitive fantasy players** that need to maximize their fantasy points
for the week to beat their opponent. Users can use the application to gain a better understanding of team performance
, and make roster decisions based on their weekly projections. I am interested in this project for my own personal
use, as I can use this application to improve my fantasy team and remain competitive in my league.
